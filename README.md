# Better Teams

Better teams is an addon for Microsoft Teams, allowing the use of custom JS and CSS.
JS can be added in form of packages. These packages can easily be added and removed.

Running Better Teams requires **NodeJS**. Just install it and inject:

* Open a command prompt inside the Better Teams folder
* Run `npm run inject`, make sure you have Microsoft Teams running
* Thats it! Better Teams is now injected

May you want to remove Better Teams again:

* Open a command prompt inside the Better Teams folder
* Run `npm run uninject`, make sure you have Microsoft Teams running
* Better Teams is now uninjected
